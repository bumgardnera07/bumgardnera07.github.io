I enjoy solving coding problems on <a href="https://www.Codewars.com">Codewars.com</a>
I recently started adding my daily coding exercises to a <a href="https://github.com/bumgardnera07/DailyKata">repo on my Github.</a> This is a great way to practice problem solving skills and algorithm design. I've also found it to be very useful for learning new languages and techniques, through the upvoted solutions functionality.
If you're on Codewars, or want to try it out, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/bumgardnera07?">follow my profile.</a>
