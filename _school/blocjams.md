short-description:  An MVC project modeled on Spotify. Tech: Angular, MVC, JS

---

We built a Spotify clone that stores album info, artwork, and audio files to be served to the User through a conventional JS model. We then refactored the entire application with Angular to a Single Page Application using MVC framework.
