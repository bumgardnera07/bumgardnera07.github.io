short-description: An app for tracking personal wagers with your friends

---
My friends and I love to make propositional bets, but we don't always do the best job of paying our dues if we lose. This cross-platform app will maintain a common record that we all have access to. The app will have functionality allow us to make a record of new wagers as soon as they're made, track the completion of the 'debts' once they're completed, and allow for confirmation from other members once a debt is paid. I want to use this project to expand my knowledge of multi-modal functionality. Ideally, users could submit any information from a smart phone, a connected smart watch, or even Alexa. I'll have a repo up for this project soonTM! (
