I have released a few certified Alexa Skills through Amazon's Alexa Developer Console.

My most popular skill, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/George-Bumgardner-Magic8/dp/B078NKFSH8/ref=sr_1_25?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1548270067&sr=1-25&keywords=magic+8">Magic8</a>, is an 8 ball skill that gives answers to yes/no questions. It has been downloaded over 6000 times since I released it in late 2017. <a href="https://github.com/bumgardnera07/Magic8">(Github)</a>

I've also released a skill that shares assorted Joe Pesci Trivia and a skill the provides random inspirational quotes, InspireMe.

I'm currently working on converting my Ruby <a href="https://bumgardnera07.github.io/_portfolio/Connect4.html">Connect4 game</a> into an Alexa 'Blind Connect4' game where players can't see the board but must continue to play pieces until one player wins or they fill up the board.
